![Stibitz' Model K adder](https://images.computerhistory.org/timeline/timeline_computers_1937.modelk.jpg)

> In 1937, George Robert Stibitz, a scientist at Bell Laboratories built a digital machine based on relays, flashlight bulbs, and metal strips cut from tin-cans.

Stibitz's machine, which he called the "Model K" (because most of it was constructed on his kitchen table), worked on the principle that if two relays were activated they caused a third relay to become active, where this third relay represented the sum of the operation. For example, if the two relays representing the numbers 3 and 6 were activated, this would activate another relay representing the number 9. (A replica of the Model K is on display at the Smithsonian).
