# Variables, Expressions, and Statements
Chapter 2
 Python for Everybody

 Constants
• Fixed values such as numbers, letters, and strings, are called “constants” because their value does not change
• Numeric constants are as you expect
• String constants use single quotes (') or double quotes (")
>>> print(123)
123
>>> print(98.6)
98.6
>>> print('Hello world')
Hello world

 Reserved Words
You cannot use reserved words as variable names / identifiers
False class return
None if for
True def from
and del global
as elif try
assert else import pass break except in raise
is finally lambda continue while nonlocal not with
or yield

 Variables
• A variable is a named place in the memory where a programmer can store data and later retrieve the data using the variable “name”
• Programmers get to choose the names of the variables
• You can change the contents of a variable in a later statement
x = 12.2 x y = 14
y
 12.2
 14

 Python Variable Name Rules
• Must start with a letter or underscore _
• Must consist of letters, numbers, and underscores
• Case Sensitive
    Good:    spam    eggs   spam23    _speed
    Bad:     23spam     #sign  var.12
    Different:    spam   Spam   SPAM

 Mnemonic Variable Names
• Since we programmers are given a choice in how we choose our variable names, there is a bit of “best practice”
• We name variables to help us remember what we intend to store in them (“mnemonic” = “memory aid”)
• This can confuse beginning students because well-named variables often “sound” so good that they must be keywords

 x1q3z9ocd = 35.0
x1q3z9afd = 12.50
x1q3p9afd = x1q3z9ocd * x1q3z9afd
print(x1q3p9afd)
What is this bit of code doing?

 x1q3z9ocd = 35.0
x1q3z9afd = 12.50
x1q3p9afd = x1q3z9ocd * x1q3z9afd
print(x1q3p9afd)
a = 35.0
b = 12.50
c = a * b
print(c)

 Assignment Statements
• We assign a value to a variable using the assignment statement (=) • An assignment statement consists of an expression on the
right-hand side and a variable to store the result
 3.9 * x * ( 1 - x )
x=

  0.6
A variable is a memory location used to store a value (0.6)
x = 3.9 *
x
0.6
x * ( 1 -
0.4 0.936
0.6
x )
      The right side is an expression.
Once the expression is evaluated, the result is placed in (assigned to) x.

   0.6 0.936
A variable is a memory location used to store a value. The value stored in a variable can be updated by replacing the old value (0.6) with a new value (0.936).
x = 3.9 *
x
0.6
x * ( 1 -
0.4 0.936
0.6
x )
      The right side is an expression. Once the expression is evaluated, the result is placed in (assigned to) the variable on the left side (i.e., x).

 Expressions...

 Numeric Expressions
• Because of the lack of mathematical symbols on computer keyboards - we use “computer-speak” to express the classic math operations
• Asterisk is multiplication
• Exponentiation (raise to a power) looks different than in math

 Order of Evaluation
• When we string operators together - Python must know which one to do first
• This is called “operator precedence”
• Which operator “takes precedence” over the others?
        x = 1 + 2 * 3 - 4 / 5 ** 6

 Operator Precedence Rules
Highest precedence rule to lowest precedence rule: • Parentheses are always respected
• Exponentiation (raise to a power)
• Multiplication, Division, and Remainder • Addition and Subtraction
• Left to right
Parenthesis
Power
Multiplication

  >>> x = 1 + 2 ** 3 / 4 * 5
>>> print(x)

1 + 2 ** 3 / 4 * 5 1+8/4*5

 Operator Precedence
• Remember the rules top to bottom
• When writing code - use parentheses
Parenthesis
Power
Multiplication
Addition
Left to Right
 • When writing code - keep mathematical expressions simple enough
that they are easy to understand
• Break long series of mathematical operations up to make them more clear

 What Does “Type” Mean?
• In Python variables, literals, and constants have a “type”
• Python knows the difference between an integer number and a string
• For example “+” means “addition” if something is a number and “concatenate” if something is a string
>>> ddd = 1 + 4
>>> print(ddd)
5
>>> eee = 'hello ' + 'there'
>>> print(eee)
hello there
concatenate = put together

 • Python knows what “type” everything is
• Some operations are prohibited
• You cannot “add 1” to a string
• We can ask Python what type something is by using the type() function
>>> eee = 'hello ' + 'there'
>>> eee = eee + 1
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "<stdin>", line 1, in
<module>TypeError: Can't convert
'int' object to str implicitly
>>> type(eee)
<class'str'>
>>> type('hello')
<class'str'>
>>> type(1)
<class'int'>
>>>
Type Matters

 Several Types of Numbers
• Numbers have two main types - Integers are whole numbers:
-14, -2, 0, 1, 100, 401233
- Floating Point Numbers have decimal parts: -2.5 , 0.0, 98.6, 14.0
• There are other number types - they are variations on float and integer
>>> xx = 1
>>> type (xx)
<class 'int'>
>>> temp = 98.6
>>> type(temp)
<class'float'>
>>> type(1)
<class 'int'>
>>> type(1.0)
<class'float'>
>>>

 Type Conversions
• When you put an integer and floating point in an expression, the integer is implicitly converted to a float
• You can control this with the built-in functions int() and float()
>>> print(float(99) + 100)
199.0
>>> i = 42
>>> type(i)
<class'int'>
>>> f = float(i)
>>> print(f)
42.0
>>> type(f)
<class'float'>
>>>

 Integer Division
Integer division produces a floating point result
>>> print(10 / 2)
5.0
>>> print(9 / 2)
4.5
>>> print(99 / 100)
0.99
>>> print(10.0 / 2.0)
5.0
>>> print(99.0 / 100.0)
0.99
This was different in Python 2.x

 String Conversions
• You can also use int() and float() to convert between strings and integers
• You will get an error if the string does not contain numeric characters
>>> sval = '123'
>>> type(sval)
<class 'str'>
>>> print(sval + 1)
Traceback (most recent call last): File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module> TypeError: Can't convert 'int' object to str implicitly
>>> ival = int(sval)
>>> type(ival)
<class 'int'>
>>> print(ival + 1)
124
>>> nsv = 'hello bob'
>>> niv = int(nsv)
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ValueError: invalid literal for int()
with base 10: 'x'

 • We can instruct Python to pause and read data from the user using the input() function
• The input() function returns a string
nam = input('Who are you? ')
print('Welcome', nam)
User Input
Who are you? Chuck Welcome Chuck

 Converting User Input
 • If we want to read a number from the user, we must convert it from a string to a number using a type conversion function
• Later we will deal with bad input data
inp = input('Europe floor?')
usf = int(inp) + 1
print('US floor', usf)
Europe floor? 0 US floor 1

 Comments in Python
• Anything after a # is ignored by Python • Why comment?
- Describe what is going to happen in a sequence of code
- Document who wrote the code or other ancillary information - Turn off a line of code - perhaps temporarily

 # Get the name of the file and open it
name = input('Enter file:')
handle = open(name, 'r')
# Count word frequency
counts = dict()
for line in handle:
    words = line.split()
    for word in words:
        counts[word] = counts.get(word,0) + 1
# Find the most common word
bigcount = None
bigword = None
for word,count in counts.items():
    if bigcount is None or count > bigcount:
        bigword = word
        bigcount = count
# All done
print(bigword, bigcount)

 • Type
• Reserved words
• Variables (mnemonic) • Operators
• Operator precedence
• Integer Division
• Conversion between types • User input
• Comments (#)
