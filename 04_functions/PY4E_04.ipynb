        "In the context of programming, a function is a named sequence of statements that performs a computation. When you define a function, you specify the name and the sequence of statements. Later, you can “call” the function by name. We have already seen one example of a function call:\n",

        "```python\n",

        "\n",
        "It is common to say that a function “takes” an argument and “returns” a result. The result is called the return value.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 4.2 Built-in functions\n",
        "\n",
        "Python provides a number of important built-in functions that we can use without needing to provide the function definition. The creators of Python wrote a set of functions to solve common problems and included them in Python for us to use.\n",

        ">>> max('Hello world') \n",

        ">>>\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "The max function tells us the “largest character” in the string (which turns out to be the letter “w”) and the min function shows us the smallest character (which turns out to be a space).\n",
        "Another very common built-in function is the len function which tells us how many items are in its argument. If the argument to len is a string, it returns the number of characters in the string.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
