# Iterative Pattern: Generating a texture or textile design
from Code as Creative Medium: A Handbook for Computational Art and Design"
By Golan Levin and Tega Brain


## Brief

Write code to generate a tiling pattern or textural composition, as for wallpaper or fabric. Give consideration to aesthetic issues like symmetry, rhythm, color; detail at multiple scales; precise control of shape; and the balance between organic and geometric forms.

Your pattern should be designed so that it could be infinitely tiled or extended. Design something you would like to put on the walls or floor of your home, or that you could imagine yourself wearing. Export your pattern in a high-resolution format, and print it as large as possible for your peers’ review. Remember to sketch first.

## Learning Objectives
• Create visual designs using the Cartesian coordinate system and combining drawing functions
• Use functional abstraction to encapsulate the code for modular design elements
• Generate and critique designs with symmetries and/or seamless repetition

## Variations
• Experiment with 2D graphics transformations, such as rotation, scaling, and mirror reflections.
• Use nested iteration to develop 2D rhythms or other gridlike visual structures.
• Create a helper function to abstract the way in which a complex visual element (such as a flower, animal, fruit, or fleur-de-lis) is rendered throughout your design.
• Reproduce a preexisting textile or wallpaper design using code only.
• Make a kaleidoscope by incorporating a photographic image or video feed into a pattern with symmetric reflections.
• Have your pattern printed on real fabric or wrapping paper. Consider other output devices or on-demand services for realizing your pattern, such as computer-controlled laser cutters, knitting machines, or lace-making machines.
• Make an animated “dynamic wallpaper” loop to use in the background of your videoconferences. Your design should scale gracefully by rendering correctly at different canvas resolutions.

## Making It Meaningful
Pattern is the starting point from which we perceive and impose order in the world. Examples of functional, decorative, and expressive pattern-making date from ancient times and take the form of mosaics, calendars, tapestry, quilting, jewelry, calligraphy,
furniture, and architecture. There is an intimate connection between pattern design, visual rhythm, geometry, mathematics, and iterative algorithms. This prompt invites the creator to hone their understanding of these relationships in formal terms. An important variation of this prompt is to realize designs physically, through either digital printing, fabrication in an unusual material, or at an unexpected scale. This can be a watershed moment of synthesis for software artists who crave making something physical.
