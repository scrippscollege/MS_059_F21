        "As we want to solve more complex problems in Python, we need more powerful variables. Up to now we have been using simple variables to store numbers or strings where we have a single value in a variable. Starting with lists we will store many values in a single variable using an indexing scheme to store, organize, and retrieve different values from within a single variable. We call these multi-valued variables \"collections\" or \"data structures\".\n",

Without getting into too many details, MBOX is a text file, which stores emails consecutively. Emails are separated by a special line which starts with From (notice the space). Importantly, lines starting with From: (notice the colon) describes the email itself and does not act as a separator. Imagine you wrote a minimalist email app, that lists the email of the senders in the user’s Inbox and counts the number of emails.\n",
