Amazing, thank you!

Could we replace humans with AI? Would that be going backwards?
If the guy agreed to the performance and seemed uncomfortable, does it mess up the results? What does his reaction tell us about humans watching humans?
Why would people feel more comfortable sharing data and being followed by an AI than a human?
How can we create support for disadvantaged groups while considering intersectionality?
Someone mentioned that Lauren did not necessarily meet all their needs since she would suggest something and it would not be what she wanted internally. How would having an AI instead of a human solve that problem? Would it be able to solve the problem?
What is the relationship between privacy and control?
What is the importance of having people talk about themselves?
Does envying Alexa mean we are starting to have a desire to help others more by watching and accessing their needs with technology?
What understanding of social rules does one need to have in order to make something like Alexa more personalized?
Does having a human watching makes us more vulnerable because we know we have someone who might have had similar feelings before and we can talk to them or because there is a lack of privacy?
Can we merge human and AI to create a well rounded experience/app for people? Are there any disadvantages?
What is the connection between emotion and technology? Isn’t technology supposed to be less emotional?
How can we hold other apps and creations accountable for building inclusivity?
Does having people telling us or even suggesting what we should do help us or cause us to be more self conscious? For example in Lauren and the dating job she mentioned.
Why do people want relationships with people they don’t need to talk to? How would a relationship be defined?

How does automating tasks relate to the balance of control vs safety?
What other ways are there (besides commenting) are there to make code more welcoming to a more diverse range of people?
How do we make sure we use data gotten from machine learning responsibly?
How do most people find machines giving us advice on how to act more human?
Is there a lot of tech about human interaction because so much of our time is interacting with other humans?
How much collaboration between companies is there about these machine learning projects? It sounds like a lot of these just repeat others (eg face reading)
How does plagiarism affect digital art, since it’s much easier to copy something if it’s digital vs physical?
Is it important that people know how code they use works?
How does today’s technology look similar or different than how we think it would look historically?
What are the implications of AI matching people together, like in dating apps or Uber?
When should code be free?
Should all code be available in all countries? Or are there good reasons for partial censorship?
Does being spied on by ai feel as creepy as being spied on by a person?
What are ways in which people make code for entertainment purposes?
Why are many media platforms focused on a binary of emotions (eg like or dislike)
Belinda — Yesterday at 10:20 PM
From the podcast:
Are we more connected when we text or videocall, or when we write each other letters (before technology advanced)?
Is possibly infringing on people’s privacy morally worth it for possibly life-altering developments/inventions?
Would the potency of imagining someone also have something to do with feeling vulnerable when thinking/writing about someone, as if that person knew everything you were thinking?
What is the difference between Lauren’s human Alexa and having a personal assistant?
Why are people so willing to let Alexa into their homes without thinking that such technology could infringe on their privacy?
Why were people less frustrated with Lauren’s human Alexa than with actual Alexa? Is the primary reason that Lauren represents a human being, which we regard as more “on our level?”
Does this frustration mean that Alexa is “lesser” than a human? (However, someone also said she would try out Lauren before going for Alexa)
Why is Alexa a female voice, and does that have anything to do with our frustration talking to her or our ease in welcoming her home?
It seems that a major distinction between AI and humans is emotional capability. Would we actually want or need AI to be able to express emotions, or is it important to keep this difference and not "progress" AI to such an extent?
If Alexa had a male voice, would those who are concerned about ordering a female voice around eagerly accept Alexa, and on the contrary, would many current users be dissuaded from further using Alexa?
Are we in a way conditioned to look down on technology and see ourselves as superior, given that we expect it to perfectly understand everything we want it to and are generally fearful that it will someday take over our jobs?
Will there ever be tech that only solves problems and doesn’t create further problems?
What are some reasons that many people experience a lack of interpersonal connection when using Zoom, even though there is certainly room to be vulnerable on it by turning on your camera, and some in-person meetings probably felt as meaningless/unlively as Zoom calls?
Though not as stigmatizing now, why are romantic relationships formed through online connections looked down upon, while most of us rely on media to a certain extent?
How can we strike a balance between respecting people’s right to consent and recognizing that their beforehand knowledge that they are being evaluated in some way as part of a study or project can largely affect their responses (as with the dating example discussed in the podcast)?
Can the fact that Alexa is an unobtrusive part of a home contribute to/be related to many people’s difficulty in connecting with others (we are already conditioned to interact with something that we don’t typically need to look at in order to indicate interaction, and it is something that only responds to you/doesn’t ask you questions beyond clarifying ones; additionally, it may not pick up lengthier requests as well as ones that are short and to the point, typically unlike how people communicate with each other)?
What kinds of questions do artists consider when they set out to create art?
Why is art not typically considered useful if it answers questions?
